# Rails ERB Lint

Checks for the validity of your ERB views.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3 or greater

## Usage

cd your-rails-app
rails-erb-lint check app/views/**/*/*.html.erb

### To Do

I have a long list of things in mind but much of it is opinionated.
This will exist as a tool for checking critical issues for now.
